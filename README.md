Overview
WHAT IS THE FIRST BIG DECISION ONE TAKES IN IT’S LIFE?

TAKING ADMISSION IN A UNIVERSITY WOULD BE A  VALID ANSWER TO THIS.

SO WHAT IS THE BIGGEST ISSUE ONE FACES WHILE DOING SO?

APPLYING FOR COLLEGES AND FILLING THE APPLICATION FORM ITSELF. WE HAVE TO FILL THE SAME FORM AGAIN AND AGAIN FOR A DIFFERENT UNIVERSITY, AND THE JOB BECOMES VERY TIRING AND BORING, AND MOREOVER ONE IS MORE LIKELY TO MISS ON SOME OF THE UNIVERSITY FORMS ON THE WAY.

Goals

1. To create a platform where a student just fill a one time application form and leave it on us to apply to every university they wish to, without having to apply for it differently for every university or exam.

2. To also create a social platform for students of different universities to connect on a local common point and create their own community and increase their reach in the world.

3. To provide to all the basic needs of student pursuing professional studies in any college making it a one place solution for everyone and everything, right from filling an application form to making a local community of students, to creating a platform for university reviews, to having sponsor companies for college events, and also for internships for students in a later period when we have a scalable user.

4. Will provide information about companies inclined towards college events and sponsoring.

Milestones

THE FIRST STEP

During the initial stages of the web application we will provide students with a platform to fill out application forms for different exams through a one time application form and providing details of colleges as provided in their official sites.

THE NOOB HAS GOT A HAND

Once we have a sufficient community of students and the admission period for most of colleges is over, we plan to provide a local social media platform that connects students admitted in same colleges providing them local point of connection making it easier to create a good connection in their colleges. We will also be open to every student for signing up on our site irrespective of the fact that they have already got admitted in a university/college, this will increase our reach and we would be in a position to provide reviews for colleges on the basis of the students reviews studying in a particular university.

SEEMS LIKE WE ARE THE PROFESSIONALS 

Once we have an appreciable amount of active users we are on scale to contact universities, colleges, start ups, and companies to shake hands with us.
This would provide us with our own authentic data about a particular college/company, which would increase our reach in the community, making us eligible to increase the scale of our site and providing a platform for students to create their professional profile that could be viewed by the companies or even by the college heads’ so that they could recommend students on the basis of their skills.

NOW WE CAN BE THE GAME CHANGERS

We have student crowd, we have a social platform, we have colleges on board, we have companies collabed.

So now we can provide students with internships based on their skills moreover they can apply for companies directly from our site, they can again apply for higher educations, apply for different scholarship exams required for foreign universities. 

In short we could be a one stop destination for a student’s career. Every student would get a sorted life, without worrying about where to get the information about various exams to everything required during his/her studies.
